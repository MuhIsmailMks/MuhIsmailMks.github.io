                            BLUE Microphones first creation was the “bottle,” a versatile studio XLR microphone encompassing interchangeable capsules curated to isolate sonic signatures for any application which became widely used among professional recording musicians. At the time, Skipper’s daughter Jessica, an aspiring singer at age 12, suggested to Skipper to create a microphone for sending audio recordings through the internet. Jessica grew up playing softball with Skipper, so she made the shape with her hand when suggesting the microphone idea of what is known today as the Snowball—similar in size to a softball. (Per BLUE's website, the Snowball is 325 millimetres (12.8 in) and softballs range from 305 to 410 millimetres (12.0 to 16.1 in) circumference.) With a nudge from Apple Inc., the Westlake Village company created a low-cost condenser microphone called the Snowball for use with music recording software, GarageBand. That microphone became popular  with aspiring pro musicians and dedicated hobbyists as an alternative to renting time in a recording studio.

Tim Gideon, writing for PC Magazine, rated the headset 4 out of 5 stars, and praised it for its "high quality audio performance," and for being "ideal for athletes who need a very secure fit for intense training." Jeff Dunn from Business Insider included the X2 in his list of "best headphones for working out." Dunn commented, "For the best sound from an exercise-oriented headphone that isn’t outrageously overpriced, go with the Jaybird X2." Dunn warned, however, that finding the best fit for each individual user could take time to set up as the headset is shipped with rubber buds, foam earbuds, and fins of various sizes for the user to configure to their ear size.

                            From the beginning, Ultimate Ears partnered with Westone to manufacture Harvey's designs, but in 2001 Westone began to operate a separate distribution channel in Europe, selling the IEMs as their own designs, holding all the Ultimate Ears trademarks and patents. Relations between Westone and Ultimate Ears soured. Harvey did not have any patents, so it was difficult for him to separate his design, marketing and sales business from the manufacturer. At the beginning of 2002, Ultimate Ears opened their own lab, hiring Chomphorn "Noy" Soudaly, an audiologist and hearing aid technician, to run the lab. In April 2002, Ultimate Ears produced an upgraded model without Westone's help.  The Harveys were able to retain nine out of ten customers; the remainder became customers of Westone. In 2003, Ultimate Ears had five employees and held about 80% of the professional IEM market.
